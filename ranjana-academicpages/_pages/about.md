I am Ranjana Rajendran, a Machine Learning Engineer and researcher-in-transition with over a decade of experience in **distributed systems, big data pipelines, and applied AI**.

Currently in a strategic pause ("Hit Reset") while preparing for a PhD in Computer Science & Engineering, I build projects spanning traditional ML, deep learning, and generative AI.  

This site consolidates my **resume, projects, publications, and patent** for academic and professional audiences.
